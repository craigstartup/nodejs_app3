Survey Interview 13 TranscriptInterviewer: Alright. So first question I have for you is what actually initially motivated you to start working with Results? And were there any pain points that you were hoping to resolve with their execution system?Interviewee: We started working with Results, initially, because we went through one of their seminars and had filled out a survey that just really gave us a clear understanding that we weren't doing a lot in the way of vision and purpose and sharing that with our team. And that we also really didn't have a lot going on when it came to like a systemized approach to improving our business, or like annual planning, strategic planning, that kind of thing. So it was just kind of getting to that point where we realized that those were things that our management team, our leadership team wanted and just didn't really know how to do, that kind of led us to taking the step to go with Results.Interviewer: Okay, perfect. And how did the Results’ execution system meet those needs or solve any of those pain points that you mentioned?Interviewee: We definitely made a lot of progress, and I think, on having a stated purpose and values that we shared with our team. We, I think, grew to understand why the annual planning, quarterly planning, and accountability was important. So we made progress on that, but we didn't probably fully realize the benefit of Results system, just because I think, ‘we’ is a lot for us to learn. Interviewer: Right. Okay. And how long were you actually a client?Interviewee: Just over three or two -- two and a half years. I can't remember exactly when we joined. Two and a half years, I think.Interviewer: I got you. And what made you choose Results over a competitor or just an alternate process?Interviewee: They were there. They had that workshop that kind of gave us those questions about what we were doing. So they just kind of -- that door led to them and we didn't really check out what other options there were for similar types of training and facilitation.Interviewer: I got you. Okay. And did you experience any friction or frustration points as a client through the Results process at all?Interviewee: Any frustration or friction? Did you say?Interviewer: Yeah, any friction or frustration points as the client throughout the process with Results?Interviewee: Yeah, we had a lot of friction and frustration. A lot of it was directed inward, I think, at ourselves and kind of at our group and our team. So definitely just going through the process, we probably shifted the makeup of the team that was participating four or five times. And then we switched facilitators about halfway through our time, maybe a little bit more than halfway through. And that also just came from, I think, some frustration for us with maybe not -- our first facilitator was well matched to help us through the very early stages of process and introducing us to it. But then as we progressed, we didn't feel like he called us out and challenged us in the way that we needed to and kind of let us get away with a lot, he didn't hold us as accountable as we needed.Interviewer: Thanks for that. And have you referred Results to anyone else?Interviewee: Yeah, I'm not sure if anybody else that I've referred is actually ever become a client yet but I've talked about Results to lots of people. Interviewer: Okay, great. And what would you consider as Results’ strengths and what would you consider as their weaknesses? Interviewee: I think their strengths that they've got a really well-documented process and a lot of good material for training. They have got a really good network of people. So through Results, just having the opportunity to meet other business people that are kind of like-minded and seeking to improve themselves in their business is really good. They have, generally, I think, really high-quality facilitators, like the business execution specialists are really good. Weaknesses? I would say that they're really strong in the first year and just kind of getting you into the process and introducing you to all of the new things, but then once you've been doing it for a while, it can get a little bit stale and it can feel like you're not moving. And it doesn't really feel, like when you get to the second year, that it's new and exciting and that you're graduating or moving up. It just kind of felt like a little bit of a repeat of the first year.Interviewer: I got you. Perfect. Alright. And what actually caused you to start working with Results?Interviewee: I would say budget was a huge part of it. And then, in addition, I think, we felt like we were kind of stuck and that we were not moving forward. And we weren't getting through issues and really making meaningful changes as a result of our participation.Interviewer: Okay. And is there anything that would cause you to reengage with the Results team?Interviewee: Yes, I think -- like I would consider working with Results again when we're ready. What would make us ready? I'm not entirely sure. I think that we got introduced to this whole process and different way of thinking about our business, but ultimately, it's up to us to do what needs to be done and to run our business and to make changes. And just going back week after week and having conversations about it, doesn't actually create that change. And I feel like, in some ways, that our team kind of abdicated responsibility when we were meeting weekly, that they kind of like -- they thought that they -- it was almost like hand-holding like they thought someone else was going to do the work for them or that they would guide them to the answer. And that's just not the case, like I think Results does a good job of facilitating, but it's only going to be as good as the kind of where the people within it are going to perform to. And I'd say before we reengage with Results, we'd have to get to a point as a team where we really had a better understanding of how we could individually get value from engaging with the process. This is such a time-intensive exercise like it’s a lot to drop everything, go out there for an hour. For us, it was more like two, two and a half hours and end up being on the other side of the city. So it just -- yes, I could see it sometime in the future but I think right now, we -- I feel like we need to not have our handheld and we have to kind of go without a safety net.Interviewer: Yes, thanks for that. Alright, well those are pretty much all the questions I had. But is there anything else that you'd like the Results team to know or just any other pieces of feedback that you'd like to share? Interviewee: Yes. I mean other than to reiterate how much we love the people there and just really we felt cared for and really like that they just personally really engage with us and gave us a really genuine connection. And yes, it was beyond a business feeling of the business relationship; it really felt personal, like they personally cared for us and that was really amazing and something that really helped us, I think.Interviewer: Okay, awesome. Well, thank you so much for your time today. I really appreciate you hopping on the call. Interviewee: Yeah. Interviewer: All right. Well, you have a wonderful rest of your week then. Interviewee: Okay, you too, Chelsea. Interviewer: Thanks. Bye.

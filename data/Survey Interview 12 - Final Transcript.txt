Survey Interview 12 TranscriptInterviewer: Alright. So first question I have for you is what actually got you, initially, talking to the Results team?Interviewee: Well, I guess, as a corporation, we're going through some major shifts. So we are a management consulting company that does also application support in a very unique space; asset information and engineering information systems. We've been a Canadian-based company, or more importantly, an Alberta-based company and we're expanding into Houston. And on top of that, we've identified that we haven't done a good -- like the company is growing, but at the same time, we haven't done a good job of creating a strategic roadmap and then, more importantly, executing on those internal initiatives, I’ll call it. Interviewer: I got you. Okay, great. Interviewee: That was the reason for engaging Results and some similar type companies.Interviewer: Perfect. And what actually caused you not to choose Results? Or was there anything missing or just disappointing in your experience with them?Interviewee: Yeah, so we thought, for the most part, that they've been through similar engagements with other companies; and to link back the first part of what I talked about, one of our key requirements was that -- our company is a private company, we're made up with six partners. And because of the day-to day-demands of delivering for our clients, we’ve identified that we needed not only some company that help us with our strategic roadmap but also help us execute these internal strategic initiatives. And so by that, we were clear in it, we – once the roadmap was created and the top two or three initiatives were decided, we wanted a company to help us execute that work; so create the content, review with the partners and help deliver, I’ll say, some of those elements. And what we found was that Results basically wanted to sell a subscription model to create that, I'll say, strategic plan. And then as part of the subscription model, you have a monthly meeting, but it was really then just holding us accountable to create the deliverables and execute the work. And that's where we didn't feel that their model was really listening to our needs. And they wanted to execute one way where basically just act as the PM to execute the work when we wanted somebody to bring in some business analysts, to bring in some consultants, to actually execute the work as well. And that's where we didn't find that they were listening.Interviewer: I got you. Okay. Thanks for that. And were there any other coaching or consulting companies that you looked at during your decision-making process? Interviewee: There were, Yes. Interviewer: I got you. And did you consider Results a top or final choice in that process?Interviewee: Well, they -- so we did – So yeah, we looked at, I think, six different entities I'll call it. There were three companies that were -- including Results, that were similar structure, that kind of specialize this and then we also talked to three individuals, I'll call it, that do similar type of work and so, Results did make the shortlist to the three -- the final three. But it was that lack of flexibility during the execution phase is where they actually lost the work. Interviewer: I got you. Okay. And would you be able to share just some of the names of the other coaching and consulting companies that you guys looked at?Interviewee: If it's okay, I'm going to say, no. Interviewer: Okay, perfectly fine. Alright. Okay. And what was the most valuable part of your interaction with Results? -- Or your interaction with Results team?Interviewee: Good question. Well, again, I mean -- I think it was just the blend of the one-on-one meetings that we had with them, and then basically just seeing their responses to that. So we did get an initial – like we provided a high-level overview of where we were at a company, what we were looking for, and then we did have quite a detailed one-on-one meeting with them, with myself and a couple of other senior partners. So we found that valuable and understanding, their style, their culture, their execution methodology. So that was a positive. Again, I think, the disconnect was that after that -- and then we provided a little more feedback of what we were looking for; again, we just didn't feel that they were quite listening, they were trying to put a square peg in a round hole and asking us to follow their methodology versus adjusting to meet our needs.Interviewer: I got you. Okay. And you may have already touched on this a little bit, but feel free to either just reiterate what you've already stated or expand on it further. But what would you consider as Results’ strengths and what would you consider were their weaknesses?Interviewee: I think strength is that we did feel that they've dealt with similar types of companies. They dealt with companies that were dealing with similar challenges. And we felt that the coaches that they would be bringing in under like have done this before. So those were the positives. And then again, I think the challenge was there's no right or wrong. But we just kept coming back to the subscription model, it was the only way they were willing to engage with clients. In some instances, that's fair, but in others, to me, that just seemed a little too rigid.Interviewer: Got it. Thanks for that. All right. Well, those are pretty much all my questions, but just to wrap up, is there anything else that you'd like the Results team to know or any other piece of feedback that you like to provide?Interviewee: No, I think that's -- I mean, I think, for us, that's the main items.Interviewer: Okay, perfect. Well, thank you so much for your time today. I really appreciate it again.Interviewee: No worries. Sorry. Take care.Interviewee: Thanks, you too. Have a great week. Bye.

Survey Interview 14 TranscriptInterviewer: Okay. So first question I have for you is what actually got you talking to Results initially?Interviewee: It was – Essentially, we were at a conference in Kananaskis in March, they were presenting on their Taskify system there, so that's how we got connected with them at their BEx Summit.Interviewer: Okay, great. And was there anything that was missing or even just disappointing with your experience with the Results team at all? Interviewee: In terms of -- In relation to the Taskify or the conference or what was it? Interviewer: Well, okay. Let me ask this first, what caused you not to actually choose to work with Results?Interviewee: Sorry, yes, because there's two -- they have two systems. There's the Taskify, which we -- you said Taskify or is it…?Interviewer: So I'm like I'm a third-party researcher as part of Taskify, but all of the interview questions, those pertain to Results Canada.Interviewee: Yes, yes, okay. Sorry. Interviewer: No, no, we’re perfectly fine. Interviewee: Because we do use Taskify for different parts of our business. So for an estimating piece, so…Interviewer: I got you, okay.Interviewee: Yes, that's kind of like the offshore outsourcing, right? Which we do, yes, for an estimating so -- but on the Results side of things, we -- I think, like all three of us partners were both part of EO, Entrepreneurs’ Organization and so, we drink a lot of the same kool-aid that Results is pumping; and when we met with them and went through their system and whatnot, yes, we just felt that -- at that time that we could self-implement a lot of the strategies and the best practices that they're talking about. So probably not so much on them, it’s more on us. We're just banking on ourselves.Interviewer: Yes, no problem. Okay. And were there any other coaching or consulting companies that you did look at?Interviewee: There was one other guy, it’s more of a -- yes, like one-man consulting guy. Little different approach. The cost was, probably in that case, they’re both the same, it is more condensed, so it just wasn't a fit for us. Interviewer: I got you. Okay. And was Results ever a top or final choice in your decision-making process? Interviewee: Was it a …? Sorry, I missed the first part. Was it a…?Interviewer: A top or a final choice in your decision-making process?Interviewee: Had we chosen a consultant, yes, they probably would have been.Interviewer: I got you. Okay. And what would you consider as Results’ strengths? And what would you consider as their weaknesses?Interviewee: Well, I think their strength is that they have a really defined process and its very kind of -- I think they truly believe in wanting to help small-medium businesses, for sure, so that’s where you get that sense from. Weakness, I don't know that maybe for us, anyway, and I can't obviously speak for everybody, but for us, maybe it was just maybe not as many tools in the toolbox that we thought they might have. And also a lot of the -- I think they're really good at holding people accountable but not certain that they have, like, say necessarily the -- here's an example of something that another company's done to help you apply it into your business, right? We didn't get that sense, right. So yeah…Interviewer: Perfect. And what was -- what would you consider as the most valuable part of your interaction with the Results team?Interviewee: Actually making connections in the industry at their conference. And yes, business leaders, thought leaders…Interviewer: Okay, great. Okay, I think those are all of my Questions. But before we wrap up, is there anything else that you would like the Results’ team to know or any other pieces of feedback you'd like to share?Interviewee: Just -- Yes, I think they're a great, great group of people and we'd certainly like to engage them possibly in the future for some other stuff just when we feel it may be the time's right or whatnot so --- I like Jeff, he's a good guy and I like what he’s doing, so for sure.Interviewer: Okay. Awesome. All right. Well, thank you so much for your time today. I really appreciate you hopping on the call.Interviewee: Yes, yes. Sorry. It took a little bit, sort of, like to set up the… I mean, you’ve zoomed before we're Microsoft companies’ team, it actually works really good. And so don't do many calls with Zoom. But so -- there’s first for everything, so works pretty good. Interviewer: Exactly. Yeah. No worries at all. Alright. So you have a great weekend and have a good day.Interviewee: Yes, you too. Thanks, Chelsea.

Survey Interview 2 TranscriptInterviewer:  Alright. So the first question, what initially motivated you to start working with Results?Interviewee: I think it was a couple of their seminars -- like free. Yeah, I guess it was like a seminar that they had put on by some other people. I went -- we went to -- I went to one and then our team went to another one. And then we already liked it and started talking and I knew Jeff Tetz as well. And that's how it started.Interviewer: Perfect. And were there any pain points that you were hoping to resolve with the Results’ execution system?Interviewee: I don't know if there are any specific pain points. We just knew we wanted to get a lot better at executing our strategy and having a strategy, I guess, was one.Interviewer: Okay. And how has the Results’ execution system met those needs or solved any of those pain points?Interviewee: Extremely well, yeah, Results has been great for us. They've really kept us on track and focused on our strategy and helped us build a strategy and helped us kind of focus on working on the business rather than just in the business all the time. That's been a really big one. Yeah, there's just been a lot of different things that they helped us out with. Interviewer: Okay, perfect. And how long have you been a client now?Interviewee: This is been over four years.Interviewer: Got you. And what made you choose results over a competitor or just an alternate process?Interviewee: I think my relationship with Jeff Tetz and again, just going into their seminars by one of their business execution specialists and just seeing how they operated do we kind of clipped with them right away. We thought it was a good cultural fit just to be on the same page.Interviewer: Okay, cool. And are there any pieces from the initial discovery process that you had prior to becoming a client that you felt results have not delivered on yet. Interviewee: No.Interviewer: No. Okay, great. And have you experienced any friction or frustration points as a client through the Results process at all? Interviewee: No. Interviewer: Okay, and have you referred Results to anyone else?Interviewee: Yes.Interviewer: Great. And what is one thing you wish Results offered or focused on more? If you can think of anything?Interviewee: I can't think of anything.Interviewer: Okay, no problem. And what would you say are Results’ strengths?Interviewee: Just the quality of their people, their culture, and just that they really know what they're talking about, their business execution specialists really know how to run a business or how to give advice on running a business. They just have a really good experience.Interviewer: And are there any weaknesses that you can think of with Results? Interviewee: Not that I'm aware of. Alrighty. Well, those are really all my questions. Interviewer: Is there anything else you think we should know? Or any other pieces of feedback that you want to give?Interviewee: No, I don't think so. I just we've been really happy with Results. They really helped our business and we hope we keep working with them. Interviewer: Awesome. Alright, Darryl. Well, thank you so much for jumping on this call me. I really appreciate it. And those are my questions so you have a great rest of your weekend.Interviewee: Okay, thanks. That was easy.Interviewer: Thanks. No problem. Glad to hear it. All right. Bye-bye.

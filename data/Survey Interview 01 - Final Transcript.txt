Survey Interview 1 TranscriptInterviewer: Alright, let's get started. So first question. So what initially motivated you to start working with Results? And were there any pain points that you were hoping to resolve with their execution system?Interviewee: Yeah, it's funny. We had worked with Results quite a few years ago before I was the CEO. And we didn't have very good results, to be honest, with you at all. It was something that I was disappointed in, I was General Manager at the time. And fast forward, about four or five years later, I became the CEO and our new CFO had gone to a conference and had been introduced to Jeff Tetz. And he came back bragging about this company that could help us. We were really struggling with, kind of, not really -- not maybe identifying priorities in the business but executing on them. And so, Cam, our CFO, had told us, well, we met this guy, he can help us. So I said, yeah, bring him in. And in the first 15 minutes or so, I was like, shoot, Jeff, you seem like a nice guy, but we've been down this road before and it didn't turn out very well for us, but I’m super interested. And he was like, no problem. I got an hour to kill anyway, so he hung around and talked and talked about some of the challenges and got up on the board and gave us kind of a couple of hands. And when he left, I was like, damn it, I want to give them a try. So we actually went through kind of a proper onboarding process. This time, they had changed -- they changed a lot of things in the program as well. And that was why we originally got involved in this because we recognized we needed help with, kind of, not only identifying what the priorities to the challenges were but actually mapping out a plan and then getting it done.Interviewer: Okay, thanks for sharing that. Alright. Okay, how has the Results’ execution system met those needs or solved any of your pain points?Interviewee: So I guess, for us, they did a few things. One, they helped us as a group to get aligned and would actually help our team come together pretty tight group of folks. But it helped us, I think have more honest and open conversations and really get aligned around what was important. In the first - the first six months to one year with Results, we saw a significant -- like we checked some boxes on some pretty, pretty big things that we hadn't send for a long time we wanted to do. And we actually mapped out a process and got them down. The first six months were awesome. Like we were just hammering off of shit that we just had set for years we needed to do. So right out of the gate was really good.Interviewer: Got you. And how long have you actually been a client of Results?Interviewee: We've been two and a bit years now, I think. Interviewer: Okay, yeah. Cool. And what made you choose Results over a competitor or just an alternate process? Interviewee: Well, honestly, it was probably, originally, Jeff. Super charming, very authentic. And, like just a real guy, or a real human, I guess is a better word. And he came in and in spite of the fact that I was pretty honest with him that we hadn't got what we wanted out of the Results’ sessions years earlier. He was still interested in our company, and he was still interested in learning more and given us a few tips. And so he was the one that sold us on it originally. Within our first meeting, we switched facilitators late last year. Within our first few interactions with just the Results team, we really felt like there was a cultural connection with our company and felt like they're doing -- the people there were doing this because they actually want to help companies succeed. And we felt that right away. And then really, for us, we hadn't explored a lot of other options. And once we got into this, we didn't feel any need to because...Interviewer: Okay, cool. And are there any pieces from the initial discovery process prior to becoming a client that you feel Results has not delivered on?Interviewee: I'm not sure how to answer that. I'm not sure I understand that question.Interviewer: Okay, I'll say it again. So are there any pieces or anything that was said from the end -- or during the initial discovery process before you were a client that you feel like Results hasn't delivered on or done yet?Interviewee: Nope, No. I think one of the things that we found and actually Results helped us, they sorted out and actually pushed us in a direction that I probably wasn't super comfortable with that turned out to be excellent was our original facilitator was an awesome guy and really helped us kind of in our infancy, but we started to not feel like we were getting value out of Results anymore. We kind of felt like we'd flatlined a little bit. And [Jeff] met us for breakfast and talked to Cham, our CFO, and I about how -- what was our experience. And we're honest, like, Dave is awesome, he's kind of like a part of our team and bit of a father figure maybe. But we're like, really, I think we've got most of the benefit and then getting better results. And we said we want to give it another three to six months and see. And Jeff was like, well, actually, I think we should switch facilitators. We loved David like at time, he was such a great guy. I was like, well, let's give Dave a chance. And Jeff said, honestly, it's time -- like, trust me, I believe that it's just time to, kind of, go in a different direction here and no slide on Dave. And so we did that. And one of the things that we found out by doing that is there was a whole bunch of tools that Results had in other areas of our business, not just simply execution, that Dave hadn't really shared any of that with us. And so they had a lot bigger toolbox than what we were aware of. So they actually went through the whole reorientation process with us. And we discovered that there was a lot more value that they could add to our organization. And I wondered after if some other companies who came in and who may be left after the two-year mark did so for the same reason that we were going to -- that we likely would have ended up doing the same thing. And we'd have left not disappointed, we'd have left feeling like we'd gotten everything that we could get out of Results and it was just time to move on. And I wonder if some of the other clients maybe just didn't have the relationship with a guy like Jeff to be that honest about how we were feeling.Interviewer: Right. Go ahead. Sorry. Interviewee: No, that's a -- so I didn't get a takeaway for them, might be if they don't have is a kind of the client and intimacy that – a vendor intimacy that they have with us. Some of those companies might be leaving after two to three years because they really feel like they've like they've kind of hit the ceiling with Results.Interviewer: Got it. That's super helpful. And have you -- You might have already touched on this so -- but just in case there's anything else you'd like to add to it. Have you experienced any friction or frustration points as a client through the Results process at all?Interviewee: No, we haven't at all. A cop -- While -- the probably the only thing was when we just felt like we've gotten all we could get. And we were more talking about [shit] like they are -- they become a part of our team and a part of our family and how do you transition away. And -- but there was no friction or anything on our part. They handled it professionally when we moved from Dave to Christie. And it turned out to be the right thing for our business like and Dave was the right person at the right time and Christie has certainly become the right person at the right time. I think there was -- Dave was disappointed because we were so tight, but I went --like Jeff, obviously, had the conversation with him about it and shared the news and then I actually went in and had coffee with him one on one after just to kind of let him know we love them. But it was --and the reasons why we decided to shift away. And he was honest about how he felt, certainly somewhat disappointed, right? And kind of shocked, but also so professional. And we still run into him at Results office and I still send them a Merry Christmas message and all that stuff. So our experience has been excellent with Results.Interviewer: Okay, thanks for that. And have you referred Results to anyone else?Interviewee: Yeah, actually, they got two clients. One, real significant one, actually both competitors to us. I've referred our competitors and they've gone there and they've just like absolutely loved it. Interviewer: Yeah! Okay, cool. And what is one thing you wish Results offered or focused on more?Interviewee: You know what? I don't think I can answer that because I'm sure there are some other things that they could do. But it's probably the best way to answer this is that I don't know what I don't know. I think everything that kind of comes up where there's a need in sort of this space that we believe they're in, they can cover off everything from our perspective or from our team. Interviewer: I got you. Interviewee: So yeah, hard for me to answer that specifically.Interviewer: Yeah, no problem at all. And what would you say are Results strengths in your opinion?Interviewee You know what? Like, if I was to say what was probably the biggest thing that keeps us like really connected with them, it would be the people that are employed there and the culture that they have. You know when you walk into their building or interact with any of their people, there's just a feeling that they really give a shit. And so, and that's so important to us. And then, obviously, we need them to be good at what they do and they are. So they've helped us to execute on a lot of stuff. They've been sort of counselors for us at times, kind of, probably act in before we had a real award. They probably acted more like -- they helped us with some decisions and bit of advisory. So they've really, they've really played roles outside of what we expected in that regard. But overall, it's just that they help us, they help us achieve goals that we set. But it's -- you could go someplace and get the same results but with people that maybe we didn't feel good about with and interact well with them, then we probably wouldn't stay. So I think at least people in their culture that -- and that is why I referenced some of my friends who are competitors to us. I was like, hey, these guys can help people through stuff done, but they're also just awesome people. And they got -- they have a lot of fun. Interviewer: I got you. And the final question. Are there any weaknesses with Results that you can think of?Interviewee: So, I think I think probably what I covered there around the first orientation, it's a lot of information in a day, like it's a ton, and go through and check all this stuff. And we actually didn't get kind of a review of that until after we had sat with Jeff and said, ‘Hey, we feel like we're becoming stagnant here with Dave’. And we thought it was more of the probably the Results’ process rather than and Dave. And so then Jeff sat down and went through it again. And I think that it would have been really prudent for them to have done that process sooner with us. Because like when you're starting this stuff, again, you don't know what you don't know. And you're getting all this information and then three months later, we kind of forgot it. And so then we were just being led through the Results program by the facilitator. And when Jeff kind of redid it, we looked at some of the other areas that we could have been working on with Results. And then when Christy came on, and she -- she'd hear us, we would be talking about challenges, we’re talking about leadership training or -- And we're looking into this, and she would be like, ’Well, we have that like this is one of the things I specialize in or we have this person. And so we actually found that there were a whole bunch more services and a bunch more value that we can get in one place with them. And so I don't think they did a very good job, obviously, of really selling us on that. And might have been partly because they were kind of bringing us in slowly due to the fact that I was skeptical. Yeah, I don't know. But that would be the area I think that they could improve is just like sooner they let clients know that they have all of these other programs and  expertise. I dealt with leadership development outside of execution.Interviewer: Okay, great. All right. Well, those are all my questions. Is there anything else you think that they should know or any other feedback you want to give before we end?Interviewee: No, I think they -- So Jeff and the team know that I respect the hell out of them enough that I will endorse them to friends and competitors and the feedback. So mine is probably biased, I love the guys and girls there and think that they've done an awesome job for us. But I can tell you like from the two groups that I referenced to them, there feeling is the same. And the one guy who went over there, he was a Vice President with Toyota for years and like so much business acumen and so strong and somebody I admire, and he sees value in it for different reasons than I do. But like they've renewed again for another year as well. And so that speaks volumes, right? I will reference them because of the people they are and what they've done for us. But when we reference people, they have a very similar feeling, I think, that the folks are doing most of the right things.Interviewer: Yeah, definitely. All right. Well, thank you so much for hopping on this call me today, Trevor. I really appreciated. Interviewee: Well, no worries at all. Interviewer: Okay, perfect. Well, those are my questions so you have a wonderful rest of your day.Interviewee: You as well, thanks for the call.Interviewer: Thanks. No problem.

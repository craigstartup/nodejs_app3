Survey Interview 9 – TranscriptInterviewer: Okay. So first question I have for you is what actually initially motivated you to start working with Results? And were there any pain points that you were hoping to resolve with their execution system?Interviewee: So I met Jeff several years before I started working with Results and just kind of went through -- I had a look at what they were offering at that point; and as an organization, I just didn't feel that we were ready. I’m not even sure how I would define ready, but it didn't -- just didn't feel like we were there at that point. And then, probably three, four years later, as everything evolved within our organization, yes, I reached out to him and wanted to explore the relationship again. Probably the pain point for me would have been me wanting to start getting out of the day-to-day operations of my company and starting to get my leadership group to take on all of the day-to-day operations. It was really what got me there, I guess.Interviewer: Okay, great. And how has the Results’ execution system met any of those needs or solved any of those pain points that you’ve mentioned?Interviewee: I wouldn't say solved yet, but we're just about a year in with them. So I'm definitely seeing results from working with them for sure. But we're only a year in and my leadership group is -- there's three -- I guess, two people on there that are quite young, fairly new into the business as well. So we're definitely seeing results from them working with Results. But it's still -- I think, it's still early right now in terms of seeing some real power out of there yet but I can for sure see the benefit, there's no doubt. Interviewer: Awesome. And what made you choose Results over a competitor or just an alternate process?Interviewee: I liked the idea of the cadence. And I like the idea of -- I just felt that if we weren't going to go offsite once a week and commit to that, that we probably would have not gotten off the ground with it. So some of the other folks that I spoke to, there was sort of -- they oversee it, but they are not as in all but the cadence wasn't there. So that was probably the most important thing to me is that the accountability level of having to meet once a week and kind of go through an hour's meeting and the quarterlies and all of that was really what did it for me.Interviewer: Yeah. Okay. And are there any pieces from the initial discovery process that you had prior to actually becoming a client that you feel the Results team has not delivered on yet?Interviewee: No, I feel pretty good with the deliverables that we set at the beginning. Like I said, we're still a pretty new client. So we're still, kind of, I believe, at very initial stages here. But yeah, so far, I'm very okay with what's happened. I'm probably more confident than I was a year ago in terms of being able to not be as involved in day-to-day part of my business and I can see probably a year to two years from now, I'll be in a pure governance role and that's kind of along the timeline that I was looking for. So from that perspective, I am happy.Interviewer: Great. And you probably already just answered this, but just in case, have you experienced any friction or frustration points as a client during the Results process at all?Interviewee: Yeah, but I would say that at about that sixth- or seventh-month period, we experienced a little bit of that, but it had nothing to do with them, right? It was the more internal thing, sort of re-evaluating the commitment level that we -- that's required. And so I kind of think we maybe went backwards a little bit for about a month there. But then kind of got re-engaged. And I'm guessing that's probably pretty normal. Interviewer: Okay.Interviewee: Yeah, so no, I think it was us that caused that issue, not them.Interviewer: Okay. I got you. All right. And have you referred Results to anyone else?Interviewee: I have, yes. Interviewer: Great. Interviewee: I don't know if that they've done anything about it but I've talked to two or three different organizations. Interviewer: Awesome. Interviewee: Specifically, about our experience. Yes.Interviewer: Cool. And is there anything that you wish that Results’ team offered or focused on more?Interviewee: Yeah, I think if -- what I'd like to see a little bit of is them having maybe some sort of a superlight version or some version of what they're doing with the leadership group where they could come into the organization a couple of times a year and just maybe work with the entire organization. It just sort of bring them a little bit up in terms of what this whole program is, because we're doing it internally at our quarterly meetings with all staff but I would like some of the other people other than the leadership group and even everybody in the organization to actually have a little bit of time with these folks.Interviewer: Yes, absolutely. Okay. And last question here. What would you say are Results’ strengths? and what are their weaknesses?Interviewee: Well from strengths point of view, they make it pretty easy for you in terms of coachability, like you're not having to kind of think about what do I need to do next, they’re sorta thinking about it, but they're certainly -- they're sort of setting the table for you. I mean, I did triathlons for years and I remember when I first started doing them, I kind of did my own programs and I created my own training programs. And then I went and got a coach. And once I got a coach, it sure was a lot easier and I saw bigger games quicker. And that's what I see with Results is that, internally, any company can do what these guys are doing. There's no real magic to this, but they've structured it in a way, they've got it organized in a way that if you follow their program, you're -- it's basically -- my feeling of it is that my leadership group is getting another university degree over the next four or five years just by following this program, alright? So that's what I see as the biggest strength is that you just have to, kind of, be fully committed to the program but you just -- all you have to do is just go do it. You don't have to invent it.Interviewer: Right. Interviewee: So that I like a lot. As far as the weaknesses, we have a really good solid guy that we work with there. And the whole group -- their whole group in Edmonton is really Strong. We've met all of them now and worked with some of them on other little projects. I mean I’ve got to think a little bit here because I don't really…Interviewer: Right. And if you can't think of any, that’s fine too. Interviewee: Yeah, there's -- obviously, I mean, if I sat in their boardroom with them, they would have some weaknesses they'd be working on, I guarantee of that, but I'm pretty good with everything that's going on there. They're not -- they're super professional, they're not pushy at all. And they -- but they hold you out -- they hold you really accountable, which I like, and yeah, so I'm happy with everything. Yeah. Interviewer: Okay. Perfect. Alright. Well, those are basically all my questions. But just in case, is there anything else that you'd like the Results team to know or any other piece of feedback you'd like to share?Interviewee: The biggest thing for me is that I would like them to somehow put some thought around how they can incorporate other members of the organization into their concepts. And I've already mentioned that in this discussion, but that to me would be pretty encouraging for the whole group because our group comes back and they talk sort of the Results’ language, if you will. And some of the people in the organization -- there's a gap there, right? So we're constantly trying to fill it, but if there was -- if they had some -- even some literature or some online programming that all the staff could participate in, just to even read some of the books and the articles and all that stuff that we do every week without us having to take the time to create it, I just think that would take them to a new level. Interviewer: I got you. Okay, great. Well, I really appreciate your time today and those are all my questions. So you have a great rest of your week.Interviewee: Alright, thank you so much. And sorry for not getting back to you too quickly, but I was out playing for … Interviewer: Yeah, no problem at all. I appreciate you going ahead and scheduling it though.Interviewee: Okay, thanks, Chelsea. Have a good day.Interviewer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Survey Interview 8 - TranscriptInterviewer: Okay. So first question I have for you is what actually initially motivated you to start working with Results? And were there any pain points that you were hoping to resolve with their execution system?Interviewee: That's a long answer. So first -- so what was the first part again?Interviewer: What initially motivated you to start working with Results?Interviewee: Okay. Well, I was aware of -- I had a relationship with Tim O'Connor. And I was aware of their service model and I was waiting for the right time my organization would be positioned to actually benefit from the type of services they were providing. So I was waiting until I felt that was appropriate, and then when my company was ready to handle the financial investment as well as the time and resource commitment, I proceeded to engage them. So I was pretty well aware of what services they were offering. And also, I was at a point in time where my company needed to -- needed the discipline and structure that I was unable to provide and that Results was able to do.Interviewer: Okay, great. Interviewee: And Second part was… Interviewer: Yeah, go ahead.Interviewee: No, I forgot the…Interviewer: Sorry. Were there any pain points that you were hoping to resolve with the Results’ execution system?Interviewee: Yes. So leadership training and development was a pain point. Establishing rhythms within the organization, providing -- we lacked discipline and commitment, and we didn't have a mechanism to identify vision and implementation of vision. Ultimately, the pain point was to remove or lessen the organization's dependency on me as an owner and spread out the requirements throughout the organization; in particular, with the leadership team.Interviewer: Okay, great. And how has the Results’ execution system met any of those needs are solved any of those pain points that you mentioned?Interviewee: How or if? Interviewer: Basically how? Interviewee: Yeah, okay. So yes, all of the above. Specifically, through their structured approach – their structured disciplined approach to how they put the client through their systems, the tremendous amount of subject matter, tools and materials they have and provide along that path has helped. The facilitators and coaches themselves are fantastic and able to assimilate into an organization and be able to assimilate and help facilitate easily and with minimal disruption. That's a big part of it. And their support network as well helps them be able to provide the right tools to help manage each of the different types of scenarios we deal with on a weekly basis. Ultimately, though, the quarterly planning days provide tremendous value as -- but essential to that is the weekly accountability meetings in which they hold us accountable to those goals and objectives, that's a really critical part of this.Interviewer: Cool. And how long have you actually been a client so far?Interviewee: So two years, just under two years. Interviewer: Okay, great. And what made you choose Results over a competitor or just an alternate process?Interviewee: I was familiar with their general methodology. And it was both -- and it was logical and appropriate for my business and my type of leadership style. I had a relationship with Tim O'Connor that helped me be more aware of it and more trust in terms of knowing and respecting him -- more trust in terms of that business to be able to deliver what they set out to do. And as for competitors, I felt they were positioned for a company of smaller size, not necessarily, and wouldn't be able to provide us with the tools, structures, and coaching that we needed. And again, the critical part of that was that they were providing weekly accountability meetings that would work to coach my leadership team in person along the path.Interviewer: Great. And are there any pieces from the initial discovery process prior to you actually becoming a client that you feel Results has not delivered on yet?Interviewee: I don't think -- I think there are some pieces there. I personally think that in order to achieve the objective, the puzzle doesn't have to be completely filled. I think that there are naturally gaps in that discovery phase that don't always have to have a piece put in place. So I would say -- generally speaking, I would say, yes, we are on the path or have fulfilled all of the objectives. And some of them -- it doesn't have to be 100% for it to be 100% effective if that's the right way to say it. Interviewer: I got you. Okay. And building on that, have you experienced any friction or frustration points as a client during the Results’ process at all? Interviewee: Not at all. Interviewer: I got you. Okay. And have you referred Results to anyone else?Interviewee: Yes, I have. Interviewer: Great. And what is one thing you wish Results offered or just focused on more?Interviewee: I can't really -- nothing really comes to mind. I've not felt as though they've under-delivered on anything or that there’re any gaps. The only thing I've been -- I've told them and shared with them is that, as an owner, one have to be aware and prepared that the investment required to achieve the objectives is far beyond that of the investment in Results. Interviewer: I got you. Interviewee: So an owner has to be prepared and should be prepared in advance and communicated to in advance that there's not just the investment in Results, there's the investment in the company that's going to come through effectively executing on the things that you work on in Results. Interviewer:  Right. Okay.Interviewer: So you have to be prepared to spend some money.Interviewer: I got you. Okay. And you might have touched on these points just a little bit, but what would you say are Results’ strengths? and what are their weaknesses?Interviewee: Okay, so strengths, I would say are their people; first and foremost, their experience dealing with a multitude of companies in a variety of industries but still standardizing the content. The content and availability of content that they have for their tools to help their implementers, that's extensive and appropriate and applicable. Their strengths are also their systematic approach and, I guess, primary being their people. And I guess this was the three things that really come to mind. Interviewer: Okay, great. And… Interviewee: The weaknesses, though, I've not been exposed to any. I would say is that there is -- in the process, becomes a large dependency on that facilitator or execution specialist because the relationship is formed. And if a circumstance were to rise because it's people, that that person would no longer be there, though we've not experienced that, I think that would be an inherent weakness in their model, that there really becomes a strong tie to that individual. Even though all of their people are good, I understand that, but I think that's a weakness we’re aware of and exposed to. Other than not, I can't think of anything that's wrong to me.Interviewer: Okay, cool. All right. Well, those are pretty much all my questions. But is there anything else that you like the Results team to know or any other piece of feedback you'd like to share before we end?Interviewee: I think it's important for them to know that they've been instrumental in us achieving our objectives. And we feel -- I feel, in particular, strongly that they are a great team to work with and a good use of resource investment. And they are somebody we value greatly. Interviewer: Awesome. Alright. Well, thank you so much, Charlie, I really appreciate your time today.Interviewee: Yeah, thank you. Sorry, we didn't -- couldn't connect initially, but glad we did so.Interviewer: Awesome. Thank you. Well, you have a great rest of your week.Interviewee: Thank you, you as well, Merry Christmas. Interviewer: Thanks, you too. Bye.
